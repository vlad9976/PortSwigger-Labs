An application may require the user-supplied filename to start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`. In this case, it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example: `filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`


An application may require the user-supplied filename to end with an expected file extension, such as `.png`. In this case, it might be possible to use a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example: `filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png`.
