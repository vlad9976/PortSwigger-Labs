The most reliable way to detect blind SSRF vulnerabilities is using out-of-band (OAST) techniques. This involves attempting to trigger an HTTP request to an external system that you control, and monitoring for network interactions with that system.

The easiest and most effective way to use out-of-band techniques is using Burp Collaborator. You can use Burp Collaborator to generate unique domain names, send these in payloads to the application, and monitor for any interaction with those domains. If an incoming HTTP request is observed coming from the application, then it is vulnerable to SSRF.

#### Note

It is common when testing for SSRF vulnerabilities to observe a DNS look-up for the supplied Collaborator domain, but no subsequent HTTP request. This typically happens because the application attempted to make an HTTP request to the domain, which caused the initial DNS lookup, but the actual HTTP request was blocked by network-level filtering. It is relatively common for infrastructure to allow outbound DNS traffic, since this is needed for so many purposes, but block HTTP connections to unexpected destinations.
