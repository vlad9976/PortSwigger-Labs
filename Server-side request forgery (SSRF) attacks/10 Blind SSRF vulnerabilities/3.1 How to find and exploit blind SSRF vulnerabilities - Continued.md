Simply identifying a blind SSRF vulnerability that can trigger out-of-band HTTP requests doesn't in itself provide a route to exploitability. Since you cannot view the response from the back-end request, the behavior can't be used to explore content on systems that the application server can reach. However, it can still be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems. You can blindly sweep the internal IP address space, sending payloads designed to detect well-known vulnerabilities. If those payloads also employ blind out-of-band techniques, then you might uncover a critical vulnerability on an unpatched internal server.

Another avenue for exploiting blind SSRF vulnerabilities is to induce the application to connect to a system under the attacker's control, and return malicious responses to the HTTP client that makes the connection. If you can exploit a serious client-side vulnerability in the server's HTTP implementation, you might be able to achieve remote code execution within the application infrastructure.
