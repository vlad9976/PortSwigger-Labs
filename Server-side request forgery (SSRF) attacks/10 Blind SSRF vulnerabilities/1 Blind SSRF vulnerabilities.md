Blind SSRF vulnerabilities occur if you can cause an application to issue a back-end HTTP request to a supplied URL, but the response from the back-end request is not returned in the application's front-end response.

Blind SSRF is harder to exploit but sometimes leads to full remote code execution on the server or other back-end components.
