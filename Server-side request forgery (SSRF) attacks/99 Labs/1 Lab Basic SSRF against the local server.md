Solution:

1. Browse to `/admin` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
2. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://localhost/admin`. This should display the administration interface.
4. Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
    
    `http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos`
5. Submit this URL in the `stockApi` parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.
