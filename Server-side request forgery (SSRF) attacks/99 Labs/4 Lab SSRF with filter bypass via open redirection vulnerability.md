#### Solution

1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Try tampering with the `stockApi` parameter and observe that it isn't possible to make the server issue the request directly to a different host.
3. Click "next product" and observe that the `path` parameter is placed into the Location header of a redirection response, resulting in an open redirection.
4. Create a URL that exploits the open redirection vulnerability, and redirects to the admin interface, and feed this into the `stockApi` parameter on the stock checker:
    
    `/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin`
5. Observe that the stock checker follows the redirection and shows you the admin page.
6. Amend the path to delete the target user:
    
    `/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`
