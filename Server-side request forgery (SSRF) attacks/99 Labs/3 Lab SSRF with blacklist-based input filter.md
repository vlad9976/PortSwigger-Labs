#### Solution

1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Change the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observe that the request is blocked.
3. Bypass the block by changing the URL to: `http://127.1/`
4. Change the URL to `http://127.1/admin` and observe that the URL is blocked again.
5. Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to %2561 to access the admin interface and delete the target user.
