Some applications transmit data in formats with a specification that allows the inclusion of URLs that might get requested by the data parser for the format. An obvious example of this is the XML data format, which has been widely used in web applications to transmit structured data from the client to the server. When an application accepts data in XML format and parses it, it might be vulnerable to XXE injection. It might also be vulnerable to SSRF via XXE. We'll cover this in more detail when we look at XXE injection vulnerabilities.
