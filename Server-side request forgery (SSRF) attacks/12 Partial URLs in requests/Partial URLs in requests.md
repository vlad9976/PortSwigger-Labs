Sometimes, an application places only a hostname or part of a URL path into request parameters. The value submitted is then incorporated server-side into a full URL that is requested. If the value is readily recognized as a hostname or URL path, the potential attack surface might be obvious. However, exploitability as full SSRF might be limited because you do not control the entire URL that gets requested.
