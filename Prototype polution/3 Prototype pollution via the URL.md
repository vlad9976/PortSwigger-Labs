Consider the following URL, which contains an attacker-constructed query string:

`https://vulnerable-website.com/?__proto__[evilProperty]=payload`

When breaking the query string down into `key:value` pairs, a URL parser may interpret `__proto__` as an arbitrary string. But let's look at what happens if these keys and values are subsequently merged into an existing object as properties.

You might think that the `__proto__` property, along with its nested `evilProperty`, will just be added to the target object as follows:

`{ existingProperty1: 'foo', existingProperty2: 'bar', __proto__: { evilProperty: 'payload' } }`

However, this isn't the case. At some point, the recursive merge operation may assign the value of `evilProperty` using a statement equivalent to the following:

`targetObject.__proto__.evilProperty = 'payload';`

During this assignment, the JavaScript engine treats `__proto__` as a getter for the prototype. As a result, `evilProperty` is assigned to the returned prototype object rather than the target object itself. Assuming that the target object uses the default `Object.prototype`, all objects in the JavaScript runtime will now inherit `evilProperty`, unless they already have a property of their own with a matching key.

In practice, injecting a property called `evilProperty` is unlikely to have any effect. However, an attacker can use the same technique to pollute the prototype with properties that are used by the application, or any imported libraries.
