Successful exploitation of prototype pollution requires the following key components:

- A prototype pollution source - This is any input that enables you to poison prototype objects with arbitrary properties.
    
- A sink - In other words, a JavaScript function or DOM element that enables arbitrary code execution.
    
- An exploitable gadget - This is any property that is passed into a sink without proper filtering or sanitization.
