A prototype pollution sink is essentially just a JavaScript function or DOM element that you're able to access via prototype pollution, which enables you to execute arbitrary JavaScript or system commands. We've covered some client-side sinks extensively in our topic on DOM XSS.

As prototype pollution lets you control properties that would otherwise be inaccessible, this potentially enables you to reach a number of additional sinks within the target application. Developers who are unfamiliar with prototype pollution may wrongly assume that these properties are not user controllable, which means there may only be minimal filtering or sanitization in place.
