The process of detecting and exploiting limit overrun race conditions is relatively simple. In high-level terms, all you need to do is:

1. Identify a single-use or rate-limited endpoint that has some kind of security impact or other useful purpose.
2. Issue multiple requests to this endpoint in quick succession to see if you can overrun this limit.

The primary challenge is timing the requests so that at least two race windows line up, causing a collision. This window is often just milliseconds and can be even shorter.

Even if you send all of the requests at exactly the same time, in practice there are various uncontrollable and unpredictable external factors that affect when the server processes each request and in which order.![[st4m6z20.bmp]]
