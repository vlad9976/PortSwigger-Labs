Burp Suite 2023.9 adds powerful new capabilities to Burp Repeater that enable you to easily send a group of parallel requests in a way that greatly reduces the impact of one of these factors, namely network jitter. Burp automatically adjusts the technique it uses to suit the HTTP version supported by the server:

- For HTTP/1, it uses the classic last-byte synchronization technique.
- For HTTP/2, it uses the single-packet attack technique, first demonstrated by PortSwigger Research at Black Hat USA 2023.

The single-packet attack enables you to completely neutralize interference from network jitter by using a single TCP packet to complete 20-30 requests simultaneously.

Although you can often use just two requests to trigger an exploit, sending a large number of requests like this helps to mitigate internal latency, also known as server-side jitter. This is especially useful during the initial discovery phase. We'll cover this methodology in more detail.
