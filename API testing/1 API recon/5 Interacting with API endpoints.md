Once you've identified API endpoints, interact with them using Burp Repeater and Burp Intruder. This enables you to observe the API's behavior and discover additional attack surface. For example, you could investigate how the API responds to changing the HTTP method and media type.

As you interact with the API endpoints, review error messages and other responses closely. Sometimes these include information that you can use to construct a valid HTTP request.
