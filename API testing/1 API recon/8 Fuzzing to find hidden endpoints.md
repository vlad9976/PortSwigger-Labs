Once you have identified some initial API endpoints, you can fuzz to uncover hidden endpoints. For example, consider a scenario where you have identified the following API endpoint for updating user information:

`PUT /api/user/update`

To identify hidden endpoints, you could use Burp Intruder to fuzz for other resources with the same structure. For example, you could fuzz the `/update` position of the path with a list of other common functions, such as `delete` and `add`.

When fuzzing, use wordlists based on common API naming conventions and industry terms. Make sure you also include terms that are relevant to the application, based on your initial recon.
