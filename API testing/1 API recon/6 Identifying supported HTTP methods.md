The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:

- `GET` - Retrieves data from a resource.
- `PATCH` - Applies partial changes to a resource.
- `OPTIONS` - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.

An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods. It's therefore important to test all potential methods when you're investigating API endpoints. This may enable you to identify additional endpoint functionality, opening up more attack surface.

For example, the endpoint `/api/tasks` may support the following methods:

- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieves a list of tasks.
- `POST /api/tasks` - Creates a new task.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/1` - Deletes a task.

You can use the built-in **HTTP verbs** list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods.

#### Note

When testing different HTTP methods, target low-priority objects. This helps make sure that you avoid unintended consequences, for example altering critical items or creating excessive records.
