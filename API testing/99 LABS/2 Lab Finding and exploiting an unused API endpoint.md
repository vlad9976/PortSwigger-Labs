1. In Burp's browser, access the lab and click on a product.
    
2. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, notice the API request for the product. For example, `/api/products/3/price`.
    
3. Right-click the API request and select **Send to Repeater**.
    
4. In the **Repeater** tab, change the HTTP method for the API request from `GET` to `OPTIONS`, then send the request. Notice that the response specifies that the `GET` and `PATCH` methods are allowed.
    
5. Change the method for the API request from `GET` to `PATCH`, then send the request. Notice that you receive an `Unauthorized` message. This may indicate that you need to be authenticated to update the order.
    
6. In Burp's browser, log in to the application using the credentials `wiener:peter`.
    
7. Click on the **Lightweight "l33t" Leather Jacket** product.
    
8. In **Proxy > HTTP history**, right-click the `API/products/1/price` request for the leather jacket and select **Send to Repeater**.
    
9. In the **Repeater** tab, change the method for the API request from `GET` to `PATCH`, then send the request. Notice that this causes an error due to an incorrect `Content-Type`. The error message specifies that the `Content-Type` should be `application/json`.
    
10. Add a `Content-Type` header and set the value to `application/json`.
    
11. Add an empty JSON object `{}` as the request body, then send the request. Notice that this causes an error due to the request body missing a `price` parameter.
    
12. Add a `price` parameter with a value of `0` to the JSON object `{"price":0}`. Send the request.
    
13. In Burp's browser, reload the leather jacket product page. Notice that the price of the leather jacket is now `$0.00`.
    
14. Add the leather jacket to your basket.
    
15. Go to your basket and click **Place order** to solve the lab.
