Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the **Gifts** category, their browser requests the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts`

This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

This SQL query asks the database to return:

- all details (`*`)
- from the `products` table
- where the `category` is `Gifts`
- and `released` is `1`.

The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, `released = 0`.
