**Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query. For example, submitting the username `administrator'--` and a blank password results in the following query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`

This query returns the user whose `username` is `administrator` and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.*
