The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can construct the following attack, for example:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1`

Crucially, note that `--` is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes `AND released = 1`. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.

You can use a similar attack to cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`

This results in the SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1`

The modified query returns all items where either the `category` is `Gifts`, or `1` is equal to `1`. As `1=1` is always true, the query returns all items.

#### Warning

Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.
