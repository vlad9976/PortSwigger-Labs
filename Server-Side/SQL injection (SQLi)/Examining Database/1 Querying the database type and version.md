You can potentially identify both the database type and version by injecting provider-specific queries to see if one works

The following are some queries to determine the database version for some popular database types:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Database type|Query|
|Microsoft, MySQL|`SELECT @@version`|
|Oracle|`SELECT * FROM v$version`|
|PostgreSQL|`SELECT version()`|

For example, you could use a `UNION` attack with the following input:

`' UNION SELECT @@version--`

This might return the following output. In this case, you can confirm that the database is Microsoft SQL Server and see the version used:
