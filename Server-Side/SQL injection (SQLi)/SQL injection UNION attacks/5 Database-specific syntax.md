On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:

`' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`

The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character `#` can be used to identify a comment.
