When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

Suppose that:

- The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
- The injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause.
- The database contains a table called `users` with the columns `username` and `password`.

In this example, you can retrieve the contents of the `users` table by submitting the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

In order to perform this attack, you need to know that there is a table called `users` with two columns called `username` and `password`. Without this information, you would have to guess the names of the tables and columns. All modern databases provide ways to examine the database structure, and determine what tables and columns they contain.
