Consider an application that uses tracking cookies to gather analytics about usage. Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:

`Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4`

When a request containing a `TrackingId` cookie is processed, the application uses a SQL query to determine whether this is a known user:

`SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'`

This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the results from the query are not returned to the user. However, the application does behave differently depending on whether the query returns any data. If you submit a recognized `TrackingId`, the query returns data and you receive a "Welcome back" message in the response.

This behavior is enough to be able to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability. You can retrieve information by triggering different responses conditionally, depending on an injected condition.
