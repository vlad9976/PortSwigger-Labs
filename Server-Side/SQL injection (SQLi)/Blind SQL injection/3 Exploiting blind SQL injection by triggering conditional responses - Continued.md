To understand how this exploit works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following `TrackingId` cookie values in turn:

`…xyz' AND '1'='1 …xyz' AND '1'='2`

- The first of these values causes the query to return results, because the injected `AND '1'='1` condition is true. As a result, the "Welcome back" message is displayed.
- The second value causes the query to not return any results, because the injected condition is false. The "Welcome back" message is not displayed.

This allows us to determine the answer to any single injected condition, and extract data one piece at a time.
