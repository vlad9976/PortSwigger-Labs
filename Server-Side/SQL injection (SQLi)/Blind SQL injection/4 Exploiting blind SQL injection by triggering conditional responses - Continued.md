For example, suppose there is a table called `Users` with the columns `Username` and `Password`, and a user called `Administrator`. You can determine the password for this user by sending a series of inputs to test the password one character at a time.

To do this, start with the following input:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 'm`

This returns the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is true, and so the first character of the password is greater than `m`.

Next, we send the following input:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) > 't`

This does not return the "Welcome back" message, indicating that the injected condition is false, and so the first character of the password is not greater than `t`.

Eventually, we send the following input, which returns the "Welcome back" message, thereby confirming that the first character of the password is `s`:

`xyz' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT Password FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator'), 1, 1) = 's`

We can continue this process to systematically determine the full password for the `Administrator` user.

#### Note

The `SUBSTRING` function is called `SUBSTR` on some types of database. For more details, see the SQL injection cheat sheet.
