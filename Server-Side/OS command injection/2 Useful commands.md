After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

|Purpose of command|Linux|Windows|
|---|---|---|
|Name of current user|`whoami`|`whoami`|
|Operating system|`uname -a`|`ver`|
|Network configuration|`ifconfig`|`ipconfig /all`|
|Network connections|`netstat -an`|`netstat -an`|
|Running processes|`ps -ef`|`tasklist`|
