Solution

1. Log in and upload an image as your avatar, then go back to your account page.
2. In Burp, go to **Proxy > HTTP history** and notice that your image was fetched using a `GET` request to `/files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>`. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
3. On your system, create a file called `exploit.php`, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret. For example:
    
    `<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`
4. Attempt to upload this script as your avatar. The response indicates that you are only allowed to upload files with the MIME type `image/jpeg` or `image/png`.
5. In Burp, go back to the proxy history and find the `POST /my-account/avatar` request that was used to submit the file upload. Send this to Burp Repeater.
6. In Burp Repeater, go to the tab containing the `POST /my-account/avatar` request. In the part of the message body related to your file, change the specified `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.
7. Send the request. Observe that the response indicates that your file was successfully uploaded.
8. Switch to the other Repeater tab containing the `GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>` request. In the path, replace the name of your image file with `exploit.php` and send the request. Observe that Carlos's secret was returned in the response.
9. Submit the secret to solve the lab.
