Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting such a form might result in a request that looks something like this:

```
POST /images HTTP/1.1 
Host: normal-website.com 
Content-Length: 12345 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg [...binary content of example.jpg...] ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description" This is an interesting description of my image. ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username" wiener ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--
```

As you can see, the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a `Content-Disposition` header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own `Content-Type` header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.
