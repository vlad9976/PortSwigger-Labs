While browsing the web, you've almost certainly come across sites that let you log in using your social media account. The chances are that this feature is built using the popular OAuth 2.0 framework. OAuth 2.0 is highly interesting for attackers because it is both extremely common and inherently prone to implementation mistakes. This can result in a number of vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive user data and potentially bypass authentication completely.

In this section, we'll teach you how to identify and exploit some of the key [vulnerabilities found in OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth#exploiting-oauth-authentication-vulnerabilities) mechanisms. Don't worry if you're not too familiar with OAuth authentication - we've provided plenty of background information to help you understand the key concepts you'll need. We'll also explore some [vulnerabilities in OAuth's OpenID Connect extension](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth/openid#openid-connect-vulnerabilities). Finally, we've included some guidance on how to [protect your own applications](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth/preventing) against these kinds of attacks.

This topic was written in collaboration with PortSwigger Research, alongside the paper [Hidden OAuth Attack Vectors](https://portswigger.net/research/hidden-oauth-attack-vectors).
