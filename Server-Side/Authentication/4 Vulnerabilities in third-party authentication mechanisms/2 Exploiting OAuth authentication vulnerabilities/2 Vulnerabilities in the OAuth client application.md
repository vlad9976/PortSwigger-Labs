Client applications will often use a reputable, battle-hardened OAuth service that is well protected against widely known exploits. However, their own side of the implementation may be less secure.

As we've already mentioned, the OAuth specification is relatively loosely defined. This is especially true with regard to the implementation by the client application. There are a lot of moving parts in an OAuth flow, with many optional parameters and configuration settings in each grant type, which means there's plenty of scope for misconfigurations.
