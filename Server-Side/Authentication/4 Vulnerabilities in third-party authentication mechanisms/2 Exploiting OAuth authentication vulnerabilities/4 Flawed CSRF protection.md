Although many components of the OAuth flows are optional, some of them are strongly recommended unless there's an important reason not to use them. One such example is the `state` parameter.

The `state` parameter should ideally contain an unguessable value, such as the hash of something tied to the user's session when it first initiates the OAuth flow. This value is then passed back and forth between the client application and the OAuth service as a form of CSRF token for the client application. Therefore, if you notice that the authorization request does not send a `state` parameter, this is extremely interesting from an attacker's perspective. It potentially means that they can initiate an OAuth flow themselves before tricking a user's browser into completing it, similar to a traditional [CSRF attack](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf). This can have severe consequences depending on how OAuth is being used by the client application.

Consider a website that allows users to log in using either a classic, password-based mechanism or by linking their account to a social media profile using OAuth. In this case, if the application fails to use the `state` parameter, an attacker could potentially hijack a victim user's account on the client application by binding it to their own social media account.

Note that if the site allows users to log in exclusively via OAuth, the `state` parameter is arguably less critical. However, not using a `state` parameter can still allow attackers to construct login CSRF attacks, whereby the user is tricked into logging in to the attacker's account.
